## Description of project


This application is a work day scheduler. It can be used to keep track of tasks during your work day. The text fields for each hour will change color based on the current time. Past is grey, present is red and future is green. Clicking the save button will persist the data on the page. Erase the data manually and resave to reset the text field. Jquery was used in the making of this application to practice my knowledge and understanding of it.
